<h2 id="NUTRITION">NUTRITION....<br>
Food At Work For You</h2>

<p>Nutrition is the food you eat and how the body uses it.</p>

<p>People differ in how much they want to know about nutrition,
but everyone needs to know a few facts about food and health as a
basis for selecting the foods to eat.</p>

<p>You need food to get energy for work and play, to move, to
breathe, to keep the heart beatingâjust to be alive. Children and
youths need energy from food for growth.</p>

<p>Food also provides a variety of substancesânutrientsâthat are
essential for the building, the upkeep, and the repair of body
tissues, and for the efficient functioning of the body.</p>

<p>Everyone needs the same nutrients throughout life but in different
amounts. Proportionately greater amounts are required for
the growth of a body than just for its upkeep. Boys and men need
more energy and nutrients than girls and women. Large people
need more than small people. Active people require more food
energy than inactive ones. People recovering from illness need
more than healthy people.</p>

<p>You and your family can get all the nutrients you need from
foods, but no one food contains all the nutrients in the amounts
required for growth and health. Only a variety of different kinds
of foods will supply all you need.</p>


<h3 id="guide">A guide to eat by</h3>

<p>Nutrition scientists have translated knowledge of the nutrient
needs of people and the nutritive values of foods into an easy-to-use
guide for food selection.</p>

<p>This Daily Food Guide, on pages 4 and 5, sorts foods into
four groups on the basis of their similarity in nutrient content.
Each of the broad food groups has a special contribution to make
toward an adequate diet.</p>

<p>Here are some of the reasons different food groups are emphasized
in the guide and the names of some of the nutrients these
foods provide.</p>

<p>Meat, poultry, fish, and eggs from the <em>meat group</em> and their
alternatesâdry beans, dry peas, and nutsâare valued for their
protein. This is needed for the growth and repair of body tissuesâmuscle,
organs, blood, skin, and hair. These foods also contribute
iron and the B-vitaminsâthiamine, riboflavin, and niacin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>Vegetables and fruits from the <em>vegetable-fruit group</em> are valuable
sources of vitamins and minerals. In the guide, this group is
counted on to supply most of the vitamin C and a large share of the
vitamin A value in the diet. Choices are directed toward the citrus
fruits and some other foods that are among the better sources of
vitamin C; and toward the dark-green and deep-yellow ones for
vitamin A value.</p>

<p>Vitamin C is needed for healthy gums and body tissues. Vitamin
A is important for growth, normal vision, and a healthy condition
of the skin and other body surfaces.</p>

<p>Foods from the <em>milk group</em> are relied on to meet most of the
calcium needs for the day. Milk is the leading source of the mineral
calcium, which is needed for bones and teeth.</p>

<p>Milk also provides protein, riboflavin, vitamin A, and many
other nutrients. Cheese and ice cream also supply these nutrients,
but in different proportions.</p>

<p>The <em>bread-cereal group</em>, with its whole-grain and enriched bread
and other cereal products, furnishes important amounts of protein,
iron, several of the B-vitamins, and food energy.</p>

<p>Fats, oils, sugars, and sweets are not emphasized in the guide
because they are common in every diet. Some of the fats and oils
provide certain of the vitamins, and some furnish essential fatty
acids, but the chief nutritional contribution of these foods is
energy value.</p>


<h3 id="how">How to use the guide</h3>

<p>Homemakers who follow the guide will find it flexible enough to
use in choosing foods for families.</p>

<p>Food choices within the groups are wide enough to allow for a
variety of everyday foods. Meals can be planned to include
family favorites, foods in season, and foods to fit the family budget.</p>

<p>The size of servings can be suited to the needs of family membersâsmall
servings for children and for those wanting to lose
weight; extra large servings (or seconds) for very active adults,
teenagers, and those wanting to gain weight. Pregnant and nursing
women also need more food.</p>

<p>Foods from the Daily Food Guide fit easily into a three-meals-a-day
pattern of eating. Foods from each group often appear in
each mealâbut this isnât essential. The important thing is that
the suggested number of servings from each food group be included
sometime during the day.</p>

<p>Many people want and need more food than the minimum
servings suggested from the four food groups. To round out meals
and satisfy appetites, you can include additional foods from the
four groups as well as other foods not listed in these groups.</p>

<p>To round out meals and meet energy needs, almost everyone will use some foods
not specified in the four food groups. Such foods include: unenriched, refined
breads, cereals, flours; sugars; butter, margarine, other fats. These often are ingredients
in a recipe or added to other foods during preparation or at the table.</p>

<p>Try to include some vegetable oil among the fats used.</p>

<h3 id="maintaining">Maintaining desirable weight</h3>

<p>It is best to maintain desirable weight for oneâs height at all
ages, even during childhood. Here are two principles that you
can useâ</p>

<p>â¢ Reduce food intake as you become less active. Exercise and
activity use up energyâor calories. If you cut down activity but
not food, you are providing more energy than the body needs.
The excess is stored as fat.</p>

<p>â¢ Reduce food intake as youâas an adultâget older. As adults
grow older, less energy is needed to keep the body functioning.</p>

<p>To reduce food intake without shortchanging the body of
essential nutrients, follow the pattern of choices suggested by the
Daily Food Guide. Weight watchers need the same types of food
for health as everyone else. Crash diets and food fads are not the
answer and may be dangerous to health.</p>

<p>Cut down on food, but donât cut out any important kinds of
foods.</p>

<p>Snacks are counted as a part of the dayâs total food. Sensible
snacking can help meet nutritional needs, but indiscriminate
eating between meals usually leads to more calories than are
wanted, less of some nutrients than are needed.</p>

<p>Specific information on controlling weight is given in Home
and Garden Bulletin 74, âFood and Your Weight.â It includes
basic weight-control facts, suggestions for reducing or gaining
weight, meals and menus, and calorie values of common foods.</p>


<h3 id="tips">Tips on meal planning</h3>

<p>Keep these points in mind when you plan meals for your
family:</p>

<p>â¢ Include a variety of foods each day and from day to day.
Introduce a new food from time to time.</p>

<p>â¢ Vary flavors and textures. Contrast strong flavor with mild,
sweet with sour. Combine crisp textures with smooth.</p>

<p>â¢ Try to have some meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk or cheese at
each meal.</p>

<p>â¢ Make a collection of nutritious recipes that the family enjoys
and serve them often.</p>

<p>â¢ Brighten food with colorâa slice of red tomato, a sprig of
dark greens, or other garnish.</p>

<p>â¢ Combine different sizes and shapes of food in a meal, when
possible.</p>

</div>

<p>If you are a thrifty food shopper,
you learn to buy the kinds and
amounts of food that your family
will useâwith a minimum of waste.
To avoid waste and to make the
most of your food dollar, you also
need to know how many servings
you get from a market unit, such as
1 pound of fresh carrots or a 10-ounce
package of frozen peaches.</p>

<p>Information in this section can
help you decide how much to buy to
feed your family.</p>

<p>The amount of meat, poultry,
and fish to buy varies with the
amount of bone, fat, and breading.</p>

<p>Your best guides for selecting
meat are the U.S. Department of
Agriculture grades. Federally
graded meats carry a purple grade
stampâa shield enclosing the
letters âUSDAâ and the grade
name. These stamps divide the wide
range of meat quality into several
groups.</p>

<p>Grade stamps appear on most
retail beef, veal, calf, lamb, and
mutton cuts. Pork is not usually
graded. Some meat packers, wholesalers,
and retailers use their own
brand names to designate the
quality levels of their products.</p>

<p>USDA Prime, the top grade, is
used largely by hotels and restaurants.
USDA Choice and USDA
Good are the grades most commonly
found in retail markets.
USDA Standard and Commercial
grades are not often sold at retail.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90 bold">USDA meat inspection marks.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Another purple stamp that may
appear on fresh retail meat cuts is
the circular mark of Federal meat
inspection (below, left). This shows
that meat is inspected and passed
for wholesomeness, and that it is
processed under strict sanitary conditions.
A round mark of Federal
meat inspection (below, right) also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
appears on processed meat products
to show they are made from wholesome
meat, are processed under
sanitary conditions, and are truthfully
labeled. All fresh or processed
meat products that are shipped
from one State to another must
bear a mark of Federal inspection.</p>

<p>Not all meat is federally inspected.
Some States and cities
have their own regulations for
locally produced meats. However,
the Wholesome Meat Act of 1967
will ultimately assure consumers
that all meat is inspected by either
the Federal Government or an
adequate State system.</p>


<h3><em>Meat and your money</em></h3>

<p>At the meat counter, consider the
amount of cooked lean meat you
will get for the money you pay.</p>

<p>The prices for a pound of beef
chuck roast, pork rib roast, ground
beef, and beef liver may be about
the same at your store. In many
instances, a pound of these roasts
will provide only about half as much
cooked lean meat as a pound of
ground beef or beef liver. The other
half of the pound of roast is bone,
excess fat, and drippings.</p>

<p>So it would take twice as many
poundsâand twice as much
moneyâto feed your family the
roasts as it would the ground beef
or liver, even though the price per
pound is the same.</p>


<h3 id="poultry">Poultry</h3>

<p>In retail markets, ready-to-cook
poultry is available chilled or frozen,
whole or cut up. Processed poultry
products are also on the market in
canned, frozen, dehydrated, and
other convenient forms.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90 bold">
USDA poultry inspection and grademarks.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Look for both the round U.S.
Department of Agriculture inspection
mark and the shield-shaped
grademark on the poultry you buy.</p>

<p>The round USDA inspection
mark (above, left) means that
poultry and poultry products have
been officially inspected for wholesomeness,
are truthfully labeled,
and are not adulterated. USDA
inspection is required in plants
that produce poultry products for
sale across State lines or in foreign
trade.</p>

<p>The shield-shaped grademark
(above, right) shows that the
poultry has been officially graded
for quality. Poultry must be USDA-inspected
before it can be federally
graded. The U.S. grades for poultry
are based on meatiness, freedom
from defects, and general appearance.
The best grade of poultry
is marked âUSDA Grade A.â</p>

<p>Chicken, turkey, duck, and goose
are common forms of poultry.
Guinea is available in some markets.
The label may suggest suitable
cooking methods and indicate the
age of the poultryâfor chicken:
âbroiler or fryer,â âroaster,â âstewing
chicken;â for turkey: âfryer-roaster,â
âyoung hen,â âyoung
tom,â âmature turkey.â</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>


<h3><em>Types of poultry</em></h3>

<p>Broilers, fryers, roasters, capons,
and Rock Cornish game hens are
young chickens with tender meat.
Stewing chickens, hens, and fowl are
mature chickens with less tender
meat. Turkeys labeled fryer-roaster
or young turkey are young birds
with tender meat. Most ducks are
marketed young as ducklingsâbroilers,
fryers, and roasters. Most
geese and guineas are marketed as
young geese and young guineas.</p>

<p>Ready-to-cook chickens are sold
chilled or frozenâwhole or cut into
parts. Most ready-to-cook turkeys
are marketed frozen whole, in a wide
range of sizes; some are available
chilled. Frozen turkey halves, quarters,
or parts are sometimes available.
Ducks, geese, and guineasâlike
turkeysâare generally marketed
frozen whole. Ducklings are also
available as cut-up parts.</p>

<p>Frozen poultry, stuffed and ready
for the oven, is available in many
markets. Boneless poultry roasts
and rollsâso convenientâare also
on the market.</p>


<h3 id="fish">Fish</h3>

<p>Today there are about 240 commercial
species of fish and shellfish
marketed in the United States.
They may be fresh, frozen, or
canned.</p>

<p>Fresh fish are generally available
by the pound in these formsâwhole,
dressed, and in steaks, fillets,
and chunks. Most fish dealers will
clean, dress, or fillet your fish for
you. They can also tell you what
fish are in season and what fish
are a good buy.</p>

<p>Frozen fish are usually packed
during the season when they are
plentiful and are held in freezer
storage until distributed. This
means that you can buy most fish
throughout the year. Frozen fish
come whole, dressed, and in steaks,
fillets, chunks, portions, and sticks.</p>

<p>Canned fish and specialty items
containing fish are ready to serve or
use as bought. Canned tuna,
salmon, mackerel, and Maine
sardines are widely available.</p>


<h3><em>Market forms</em></h3>

<p>Familiarize yourself with these
market forms of fish:</p>

<p><em>Whole.</em>âFish marketed just as
they come from the water. Ask your
dealer to scale, eviscerate, and
remove head, tail, and fins.</p>

<p><em>Dressed or pan-dressed.</em>âFish with
scales and entrails removed, andâusuallyâhead,
tail, and fins removed.
Small fish are called pan-dressed
and are ready to cook as
purchased. Large dressed fish may
be cooked as purchased, but often
are filleted or cut into steaks or
chunks.</p>

<p><em>Steaks.</em>âCross-section slices from
large dressed fish cut â to 1 inch
thick. Steaks can be cooked as
purchased.</p>

<p><em>Fillets.</em>âSides of the fish cut
lengthwise away from the backbone.
They may be skinned or the skin
may be left on. Fillets are ready to
cook as purchased.</p>

<p><em>Chunks.</em>âCross sections of large
dressed fish. A cross section of the
backbone is the only bone in a
chunk. They are ready to cook as
purchased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p><em>Raw breaded fish portions.</em>âPortions
cut from frozen fish blocks,
coated with a batter, breaded,
packaged, and frozen. Raw breaded
fish portions weigh more than 1Â½
ounces. They are ready to cook as
purchased.</p>

<p><em>Fried fish portions.</em>âPortions cut
from frozen fish blocks, coated with
a batter, breaded, partially cooked,
packaged, and frozen. Fried fish
portions weigh more than 1Â½ ounces.
They are ready to heat and serve as
purchased.</p>

<p><em>Fried fish sticks.</em>âSticks cut from
frozen fish blocks, coated with a
batter, breaded, partially cooked,
packaged, and frozen. Fried fish
sticks weigh up to 1Â½ ounces. They
are ready to heat and serve as
purchased.</p>


<h3><em>Inspection and grading</em></h3>

<p>The U.S. Department of the
Interior provides an official inspection
service that enables you to
identify high-quality seafoods. Such
products may be identified by the
official USDI grade or inspection
shields that appear on the label.
Fishery products that display these
shields have been processed under
continuous in-plant inspection and
have met definite quality, processing,
and packaging requirements.</p>


<h3 id="eggs">Eggs</h3>

<p>Buy graded eggs in cartons at a
store that keeps them in refrigerated
cases. Federally graded
eggs are identified with a shield-shaped
grademark that indicates
the quality at the time of grading.
If they have been properly handled
since grading, there should be little
loss in quality.</p>

<p><em>Quality.</em>âU.S. Grade AA (or
Fresh Fancy) and Grade A eggs are
excellent for all purposes, but are
especially good for poaching and
frying where the appearance of the
finished product is important.
Grade B eggs are satisfactory for
use in cooked dishes.</p>

<p>The grade of the egg does not
affect its food value; lower grades
are as high in nutrients as top
grades. Buy either white or brown
eggs. The color of the shell does not
affect the nutritive value or quality
of the egg.</p>

<p><em>Size.</em>âEggs are also classified by
size according to weight per dozen.
Size is independent of quality; large
eggs may be of high or low quality
and high-quality eggs may be of any
size. Common market sizes of eggs
and the minimum weight per dozen:</p>

<p>
U.S. Extra Largeâ27 ounces.<br>
<span style="padding-left: 1em">U.S. Largeâ24 ounces.</span><br>
<span style="padding-left: 1em">U.S. Mediumâ21 ounces.</span><br>
<span style="padding-left: 1em">U.S. Smallâ18 ounces.</span><br>
</p>

<p>The substitution of one size egg
for another often makes little difference
in recipe results. However, in
some recipesâfor example in sponge
and angelfood cakesâthe proportion
of egg to other ingredients is
very important. For these recipes,
it may be necessary to increase the
number of eggs if you are using a
smaller size.</p>


<h3 id="fresh">Fresh fruits and vegetables</h3>

<p>Fresh fruits and vegetables are
usually best in quality and lowest
in cost when in season.</p>

<p>Whatever fruit or vegetable you
are buying, look first for freshness.
Pointers on selecting some fruits
and vegetables follow on page <a href="#Page_12">12</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>


<h3><em>Fruits</em></h3>

<p><em>Apples.</em>âGood color usually indicates
full flavor.</p>

<p><em>Bananas.</em>âBananas should be
firm, fresh in appearance, and unscarred.
Yellow or brown-flecked
ones are ready for immediate use.
Select slightly green-colored bananas
for use within a few days.</p>

<p><em>Berries.</em>âSelect plump, solid berries
with good color. Avoid wet or
leaky berries. Blackberries and raspberries
with clinging caps may be
underripe. Strawberries without caps
may be too ripe.</p>

<p><em>Grapes.</em>âGrapes should be plump,
fresh in appearance, and firmly
attached to the stems. Red or black
varieties should be well colored for
the variety. Most white or green
varieties should have a slightly
amber tone.</p>

<p><em>Melons (except watermelons).</em>âRipe
cantaloups have a yellowish
surface color; honeydews, a creamy
color; crenshaws, a golden-yellow
color mottled with green; casabas,
a yellow color; and persian melons,
a dull gray-green color. Ripe melons
of these types usually have a fruity
aroma and a slight softening at the
blossom end. A ripe cantaloup has
no stem; other melons may have
stems attached.</p>

<p><em>Oranges, grapefruit, and lemons.</em>âChoose
those heavy for their size.
Smooth, thin skins usually indicate
more juice. Most skin markings do
not affect quality. Oranges with a
slight greenish tinge may be just as
ripe as fully colored ones. Light or
greenish-yellow lemons are more
tart than deep-yellow ones.</p>

<p><em>Peaches.</em>âBest quality peaches
are fairly firm, not bruised, with
yellow or red color over the entire
surface.</p>

<p><em>Pears.</em>âSome pears, especially
winter varieties, are marketed when
slightly underripe and need to be
ripened at homeâat room temperature.
Pears are ripe and ready
to eat when they yield slightly to
moderate pressure.</p>

<p><em>Pineapples.</em>âPineapple varieties
vary greatly in color. Ripe pineapples
have a fragrant, fruity
aroma. Usually, the heavier the
fruit for its size, the better the
quality. Avoid pineapples that have
decayed or moldy spots.</p>

<p><em>Watermelons.</em>âRipe watermelons
have a somewhat dull surface and a
creamy color underneath. The interior
should be fully red and firm,
and should have few immature
seeds.</p>


<h3><em>Vegetables</em></h3>

<p><em>Asparagus.</em>âStalks should be
tender and firm; tips should be close
and compact. Choose the stalks
with little whiteâthey are more
tender. Use asparagus promptlyâit
toughens rapidly.</p>

<p><em>Beans, snap.</em>âChoose slender
beans with no large bumps (bumps
indicate large seeds). Avoid beans
with dry-looking pods.</p>

<p><em>Broccoli.</em>âLook for small flower
buds on compactly arranged heads
with good green color. Avoid yellowing,
soft, or spreading heads.</p>

<p><em>Brussels sprouts.</em>âThe heads
should be firm with good green
color. Yellowing outer leaves and
softness indicate aging. Smudgy,
dirty spots may indicate insect
damage or decay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p><em>Cabbage.</em>âChoose heads that are
firm and heavy. Outer leaves should
be fresh, green, and free from worm-holes.</p>

<p><em>Cauliflower.</em>âChoose heads that
are compact, firm, and white or
creamy white. Avoid discolored
heads and those with soft spots.</p>

<p><em>Celery.</em>âBest-quality celery is
fresh and crisp. It is clean and has
leaves that appear fresh; stems do
not have black or brown discoloration.
Avoid pithy, woody, or very
stringy celery.</p>

<p><em>Corn.</em>âGood-quality fresh corn
has husks that are fresh and green.
The ears are well filled with plump,
firm, milky kernels. Immature ears
of corn have small, undeveloped,
watery kernels. Overmature ears
have very firm, large, starchy kernels,
often indented.</p>

<p><em>Cucumbers.</em>âChoose firm, slender
cucumbers for best quality. Avoid
yellowed cucumbers and those with
withered or shrivelled ends.</p>

<p><em>Lettuce (head).</em>âSelect heads that
are green, fresh, crisp, and fairly firm
to firm. Head lettuce should be free
from rusty appearance and excessive
outer leaves.</p>

<p><em>Onions (dry).</em>âSize and color do
not affect flavor or quality of dry
onions. Clean, hard, well-shaped
onions with dry skins are usually of
good quality. Moisture at the neck
may be a sign of decay. Mild-flavored
onions, which are often
large, may be elongated or flat.
Stronger-flavored onions are usually
medium size and globe shaped.</p>

<p><em>Peas and lima beans.</em>âSelect pods
that are well filled but not bulging.
Avoid dried, spotted, yellowed, or
flabby pods.</p>

<p><em>Potatoes.</em>âBest-quality potatoes
are firm, smooth, and well shaped.
They are free from cuts, blemishes,
and decay. To judge quality more
easily, look for potatoes that are
reasonably clean. Avoid potatoes
with wasteful deep eyes. Potatoes
with green skins may be bitter. If
you plan to buy a large quantity
of potatoes, buy a few first to see
if they are the kind you want.
Early-crop potatoes, harvested in
spring and summer, tend to be less
mealy when cooked than those
harvested later.</p>

<p><em>Root vegetables.</em>âChoose smooth,
firm vegetables. Very large carrots
may have woody cores; oversized
radishes may be pithy; oversized
turnips, beets, and parsnips may
be woody. The size and condition
of the tops on root vegetables do
not necessarily indicate the eating
quality.</p>

<p><em>Sweetpotatoes.</em>âChoose sweetpotatoes
that are clean, smooth, well
shaped, and firm. Damp or soft
spots may indicate decay. There are
two types of sweetpotatoes. The
moist type has soft, moist, orange-colored
flesh and bronze or rosy
skin. The dry type has firm, dry,
somewhat mealy, yellow-colored
flesh and yellow or light-brown skin.</p>

<p><em>Tomatoes.</em>âChoose tomatoes that
are plump, firm, and uniformly pink,
red, or yellow in color. They should
be free from growth cracks, scars,
and bruises. The best flavored
tomatoes are ripened on the vine.</p>

and Garden Bulletins 141, âHow to
Buy Fresh Fruits,â and 143, âHow
to Buy Fresh Vegetables.â</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>


<h3 id="canned">Canned and frozen foods</h3>

<p><em>Canned.</em>âYou may want to
choose the highest quality for
salads, or for serving âas is.â But
second quality may do for combination
dishes such as stews, casserole
dishes, soups, and fruit puddings,
where uniform size, shape, or color
is not important.</p>

<p><em>Frozen.</em>âBuy only packages that
are frozen solid. Avoid partially
thawed packages that feel soft or
are stained. Thawing and refreezing
lower quality.</p>

</div>


<h3 id="meat3">Meat, poultry, and fish</h3>

<p>All meat should be promptly
refrigerated.</p>

<p>The transparent wrap on prepackaged
meat, poultry, or fish is
designed for refrigerator storage at
home for 1 or 2 days.</p>

<p>Meat or poultry wrapped in meat
paper when brought from the
storeâor prepackaged roasts and
steaks that may be stored in the
refrigerator for 3 to 5 daysâshould
be unwrapped, placed on a platter
or tray, and loosely covered before
refrigerating. Wrap and store fish
separately from other foods. Poultry
giblets should also be wrapped and
stored separately.</p>

<p>Keep cooked meat, poultry, and
fish, and the gravy or broth made
from them, in covered containers
in the refrigerator. Use within 1 or
2 days.</p>

<p><em>Cured and smoked meats.</em>âham,
frankfurters, bacon, sausageâcan
be stored in their original containers
in the refrigerator. Mild-cured
hams are similar to fresh
meats in keeping quality. Use whole
hams within a week, half hams and
slices within 3 to 5 days. For best
flavor, use bacon, franks, and
smoked sausages within a week.</p>


<h3 id="eggs2">Eggs</h3>

<p>To help maintain quality, store
eggs in the refrigerator promptly
after purchaseâlarge end up.</p>

<p>For best flavor and cooking
quality, use eggs within 1 week if
possible. Eggs held in the refrigerator
for a long time may develop
off-flavors and lose some thickening
and leavening power.</p>

<p>Cover leftover yolks with cold
water and refrigerate in a tightly
covered container. Refrigerate leftover
egg whites, too, in a tightly
covered container. Use leftover
yolks or whites within 1 or 2 days.</p>


<h3 id="fresh2">Fresh fruits and vegetables</h3>

<p>Fresh fruits should be ripe when
stored in the refrigerator. Some
unripe fruits will ripen if left for a
time at room temperatureâpreferably
in a cool room between 60Â°
and 70Â° F.</p>

<p>Keep bananas at room temperature.
They will turn dull brown
if refrigerated. Sort berries and
cherries; then refrigerate, unwashed.
Use promptly. Refrigerate ripe
pineapples.</p>

<p>Sweet corn keeps best if refrigerated
uncovered in husks; use it
promptly. Removing tops from
carrots, beets, and radishes reduces
wilting. Storing potatoes in a cool,
dark place prevents greening.</p>

warm, humid weather, refrigerate.</p>

<p>Store <em>nonfat dry milk</em> in a closed
container at a temperature of 75Â° F.,
or lower. Because of its higher
milkfat content, <em>dry whole milk</em> does
not keep as well as nonfat dry milk.
Keep dry whole milk in a tightly

Refrigerate <em>reconstituted dry milk</em> as
you would fresh fluid milk.</p>

<h3 id="about">About ingredients</h3>

<p>Ingredients that may be used in
place of other ingredients are listed
on the next page.</p>

<p>Recipes in this bulletin were
tested with the ingredients listed.
Sometimes a choice of ingredients
is given in the recipe or under
Variations of the recipe.</p>

<p>âFlourâ refers to <em>all-purpose
flour, unsifted</em>. In a few recipes,
where âcake flourâ is specified it
is also unsifted. Recipes in this
bulletin are not intended for use
with either instantized or self-rising
flour.</p>

<p>âBaking powderâ refers to
<em>double-acting baking powder</em> that
leavens during mixing and again
during baking. Quick-acting baking
powder (containing cream of tartar)
is single-acting; it can be used most
satisfactorily in foods that are
mixed and baked immediately. (See
One Ingredient For Another, p. <a href="#Page_17">17</a>,
for amounts.)</p>

<p>âFat or oilâ refers to any typeâbutter,
margarine, shortening, lard,
or any kind of vegetable oil. In
recipes specifying a particular type
of fatââbutter or margarine,â for
exampleâyouâll have best results
with the fat suggested. Recipes in
this bulletin are not intended for
use with whipped fats.</p>

<p><em>Solid fats.</em>âPack fat firmly into
cup or smaller measure and level
off top with straight, thin edge of
spatula or knife.</p>

<p>To measure less than 1 cup, you
can also use the water method:
Partly fill a cup with cold water,
leaving enough space for the
amount of fat needed. (To measure
Â¼ cup of fat, for example, fill cup
with water to Â¾ mark.) Spoon fat
into cup, push under water until
water level reaches 1-cup mark.
Drain thoroughly before using fat.</p>

<p>For solid fat in sticks or pounds,
cut off amount needed. A 1-pound
form measures about 2 cups; a
Â¼-pound stick of butter or margarine
measures Â½ cup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p><em>Flour.</em>âSpoon flour lightly into
measuring cup until measure is
overflowing. Do not shake or tap
cup. Level off top with straight,
thin edge of spatula or knife.</p>

<p><em>Fine meal, fine crumbs.</em>âStir
lightly with fork or spoon. Measure
like flour.</p>

<p><em>Baking powder, cornstarch, cream
of tartar, spices.</em>âDip spoon into
container and bring it up heaping
full. Level off top with straight,
thin edge of spatula or knife.</p>

<p><em>Dry milk.</em>âPour dry milk from
spout or opening in package, or
spoon lightly, into measuring cup
until measure is overflowing. Do
not shake. Level off top with
straight, thin edge of spatula or
knife.</p>

<h2 id="Main_Dishes">Main Dishes</h2>
</div>

<p>Foods that abound in proteinâmeat,
poultry, fish, eggs, and
cheeseâmake satisfying main
dishes. Thrifty main dishes often
combine these protein-rich foods
with vegetables and cerealsâbeef
stew with vegetables or dumplings,
chicken with rice, fish with stuffing,
cheese with macaroni.</p>

<p>Dry beans and peas are also
economical choices for main dishes.</p>

<p>If the main dish is not high in
protein, you can supply additional
protein with other foods in the meal.
If, for example, a pound of meat is
to serve eight persons, you might
combine it with vegetables or cereal
in a casserole or stew, have milk
to drink, and serve cheese-topped
apple pie for dessert.</p>


<h3 id="meat4">Meat</h3>

<p>Meat cooked at low to moderate
temperatures is more tender, juicy,
and flavorful than meat cooked at
high temperatures. There is more
meat to serve because there is less
shrinkage at low temperatures.</p>

<p>Beef may be cooked rare, medium,
or well done. Lamb is enjoyed
either medium or well done, but
veal and pork are usually cooked
well done.</p>

<p>Broiling, pan-frying, and roasting
are recommended for tender meats
only. Less tender cuts are more
satisfactory if braised, pot-roasted,
or simmered. For suggested methods
for cooking, see guide on [page <a href="#Page_19">19</a>].</p>

<p>Frozen meat need not be thawed
before cooking, but extra cooking
time will be required if it is not
thawed first.</p>


<h3><em>Roasting ... beef, veal,
lamb, pork</em></h3>

<p>Place roast, fat side up, on a rack
in a shallow pan. Do not add water;
do not cover. Season either before
or after cooking.</p>

<p>Check the timetable (p. <a href="#Page_20">20</a>) for
approximate roasting times. The
quality of the meat, its size and
shape, and its temperature at the
start of cooking will affect the
roasting time. Times given here
are for meats at refrigerator temperature.
Frozen roasts may take
1Â½ to 2 times as long to cook as
unfrozen roasts of the same weight
and shape.</p>

<p>If you are using a meat thermometer,
insert it so the tip is
at the center of the thickest part
of the roast, and not touching bone
or fat.</p>


<h3><em>Broiling ... beef, lamb,
cured ham</em></h3>

<p>Slash fat around edge of meat to
prevent curling. Place meat on cold
broiler grid.</p>

<p>Broiling temperature can be regulated
by the distance meat is placed
from heat source and whether the
door is open or closed during broiling.
Because broilers vary widely,
follow the manufacturerâs directions.
If you like meat well done, place it
farther from the heat source than
for medium or rare meatâto avoid
burning the outside before the
center is cooked. Place thicker cuts
farther from the heat source than
thin ones, for the same reason.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Can also be served without heating, if desired.</p>
</div>
</div>
<br>

<p>Broil until top side of meat is
browned, about half of total cooking
time. Season, turn, and brown other
side. Use timetable (next page) as
a guide to total broiling time. To
tell if meat is done, cut into it along
bone and observe color.</p>

<p>Use a low temperature for broiling
frozen meat, so the surface does
not char before the interior thaws
and cooks. Allow 1Â½ to 2 times as
long as specified in the timetable
on page <a href="#Page_21">21</a>.</p>


<h3><em>Pan broiling ... beef, lamb,
pork</em></h3>

<p>Choose thin steaks, chops, or ham
slices (1 inch thick or less). Or shape
meat patties less than an inch thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Slash fat around edge of meat to
prevent it from curling. Grease pan
lightly with fat or rub pan with fat
edge of meat.</p>

<p>Cook meat slowly over moderate
heat, turning occasionally as necessary.
Pour off excess fat as it
accumulates. Total cooking time
will be 10 to 20 minutes, depending
on the degree of doneness desired.
Pork chops may take a little longer.</p>

<p>Remove meat from pan, season,
and serve.</p>


<h3><em>Braising ... beef, veal,
lamb, pork</em></h3>

<p>Brown meat slowly on all sides
in enough added fat to keep meat
from sticking. Use a heavy pan.
Meats may be floured or not, as
desired, before browning. Floured
meats brown better than unfloured
meats. Meats that have a considerable
amount of fat and that are
not floured can be browned without
added fat.</p>

<p>Season the meat. If necessary
to prevent overbrowning, add a
small amount of liquid (about Â½ cup
for a roast). Many cuts of meat can
be braised without added liquid.
Steam from meat juices trapped
in a covered pan provides enough
moisture. Cover pan tightly.</p>

<p>Cook slowly over low heat or in a
350Â° F. oven until tender, adding
more liquid if needed. Use the
timetable (p. <a href="#Page_22">22</a>) as a guide to
braising time.</p>

<h3 id="poultry3">Poultry</h3>

<p>Serve poultry oftenâitâs versatile,
flavorful, and economical. You
can buy chicken and turkey in
convenient sizesâchilled or frozenâany
day of the year. And for variety,
try duck and goose.</p>


<p class="no-indent bold"><em>Preparing poultry</em></p>

<p><em>Ready-to-cook poultry</em> needs little
preparation before cooking. Inspect
for pinfeathers. Wash and drain
poultry.</p>

<p>Keep <em>frozen poultry</em> frozen until
time to thaw or cook. Frozen
poultry usually is thawed before
cooking, but poultry parts or whole
poultry frozen without giblets can
be cooked without thawing. Cooking
time will be longer than for
unfrozen poultry. Do not thaw commercially
frozen stuffed poultry
before cooking.</p>

<p>To thaw poultry in the refrigerator,
place frozen poultry on a
tray or shallow pan to catch the
thawing drip; if unwrapped, cover
lightly. Remove giblets from cavity
when bird is pliable.</p>

<p>If it is not practical to thaw
poultry in the refrigerator, immerse
poultry in a watertight wrapper
in cold water. Change water often
to hasten thawing. Or you can partially
thaw poultry in the refrigerator
and partially in cold water.
It takes 1 to 8 hours to thaw
poultry in cold water, or 1 to 3
days in a refrigerator.</p>

<p>Cook poultry promptly after
thawing. Stuff poultry just before
roasting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>


<p class="no-indent bold"><em>Cooking guides</em></p>

<p>Most poultry sold whole can be
roasted. Stewing chickens and mature
turkeys, however, are more
tender if braised or stewed. They
are good for stews, or to provide
cooked meat for casseroles, sandwiches,
and salads.</p>

<p>Broiler or fryer chickens can be
roasted, ovenbaked, barbecued, or
cooked on a rotisserie as well as
broiled or fried. Fryer-roaster turkeys
weighing 4 or 5 pounds can
be roasted whole, or can be cut into
parts and fried or broiled.</p>

<p>Rock Cornish game hens can
be cooked like broiler or fryer
chickens. Small ducks are suitable
for broiling or frying; larger ones,
for roasting or rotisserie cooking.
Geese roast very well.</p>

<p>Roast poultry uncovered for best
color and to reduce splitting and
shrinkage. Poultry can be roasted
with or without stuffing; unstuffed
birds take slightly less time to
cook. Cook poultry until tender and
juicy; do not overcook.</p>


<p class="no-indent bold"><em>Roasting</em></p>

<p>Prepare the poultry as directed
above. Stuff the body and neck cavities
lightly; allow about Â½ cup of
stuffing per pound of ready-to-cook
poultry. See stuffing recipe (p. <a href="#Page_28">28</a>).
Or if desired, leave poultry unstuffed.</p>

<p>Fold loose neck skin toward
back; fasten with a skewer. Turn
wingtips back of heavy wingbone
to rest against neck skin. Tuck ends
of legs under band of skin at tail or
fasten legs together close to body.</p>

<p>To roast poultry, place breast
side up on a rack in a shallow pan.
Do not cover pan and do not add
water.</p>

<p>See roasting guide (p. <a href="#Page_28">28</a>) for approximate
times for roasting poultry.</p>

<p>A meat thermometer is the best
guide to doneness of turkeys. Insert
the thermometer into the center of
the inner thigh muscle. Make sure
it does not touch the bone.</p>

<p>Salt the giblets and neck, seal
them in aluminum foil, and roast
along with the poultry. Or simmer
them in salted water until tender.</p>

<p>You can baste poultry with pan
drippings or a little fat if you like.</p>

<p>If poultry browns early in the
roasting period, cover the breast
and drumsticks lightly with aluminum
foil or with a thin cloth
moistened with fat. After poultry
is partly roasted, cut band of skin
that holds legs together.</p>

<p>Use any one or more of the following
ways to tell if poultry is done:</p>

<p>â¢ A meat thermometer inserted in
the center of the inner thigh
muscle of a turkey reaches 180Â° to
185Â° F. If turkey is stuffed, also

whole chicken or to cover pieces.
Season as desired.</p>

<p>Cover pan and cook over low heat
until the chicken is tenderâ2 to 3
hours for a stewing chicken, 45
minutes to 1 hour for a broiler-fryer.</p>

<p>Cook giblets with the chicken or
separately.</p>

made by thickening the broth, or
use in any recipe that calls for
cooked chicken.</p>

<h3 id="eggs4">Eggs, cheese, dry beans</h3>

<p>Main dishes made with eggs,
cheese, or dry beans are economical
choices for family meals.</p>


<h3><em>Cooking eggs</em></h3>

<p>For best eating quality, eggs
should be cooked with low to moderate
heat, for just the right amount
of time. If cooking temperature is
too high or the egg is cooked too
long, the white becomes tough and
the yolk mealy.</p>

<hr class="full">

<p class="center no-indent bold">Caution on Use of Cracked
or Soiled Eggs</p>

<p>Cracked or soiled eggs may contain
bacteria that can produce food
poisoning. For your protection, use
cracked or soiled eggs only when
they are thoroughly cooked or when
the foods in which they are an ingredient
are thoroughly cooked.</p>

<p>In this publication, a warning
note is given with each recipe in
which cracked or soiled eggs should
not be used.</p>

<hr class="full">

<h3>Scrambled eggs</h3>

<p>Break eggs into a bowl. Add milk
as follows: For creamy scrambled
eggs, add 1 tablespoon milk for each
ego; for dry scrambled eggs, add Â½
tablespoon milk for each egg. For a
product with uniform yellow color,
beat mixture enough to blend yolks
and whites thoroughly. If you prefer
scrambled eggs with flecks of yellow
and white, beat only slightly. Season
with salt and pepper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>Pour the mixture into a heated
frypan in which a little fat has been
melted. Cook slowly, stirring occasionally
to let the uncooked
portion flow to the bottom. Cook
until the mixture is set, but still
moist.</p>

<p>Or, if preferred, use a double
boiler. Melt a little fat in the top
part, pour in the egg mixture, place
over simmering water in the bottom
of the boiler, and cook as above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: <em>Use only clean, sound-shelled
eggs in this recipe.</em></p>


<p class="no-indent bold"><em>Variation</em></p>

<p>Before cooking the mixture, add
herbs, chopped onion, shredded
cheese, or small pieces of cooked
bacon or ham.</p>


<h3>Eggs cooked in shell</h3>

<p>Put eggs in a pan; cover them
completely with cold water.</p>

<p><em>For soft-cooked eggs</em>, heat water
slowly to simmering. Cover pan and
remove from heat. Let stand 3 to 5
minutes; allow the longer time for
a larger number of eggs or for a
firmer consistency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: <em>Use only clean, sound-shelled
eggs in this recipe.</em></p>

<p><em>For hard-cooked eggs</em>, bring water
to simmering and simmer 20 to 25
minutes. Do not let the water boil.
Serve the eggs hot or plunge them
at once into cold running water and
leave until cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: The green discoloration
that sometimes appears between
the white and the yolk of a hard-cooked
egg results from a chemical
reaction, which is harmless. To help
prevent this discoloration, cook eggs
at low temperature, avoid overcooking,
and cool promptly.</p>


<h3>Fried eggs</h3>

<p>Heat a small amount of fat in
a frypan. Bacon or ham drippings
may be used for flavor. Break eggs,
one at a time, into a saucer, and
slip them into the fat. Sprinkle
with salt and pepper. Cook over
low heat, basting with the fat, until
whites are firm.</p>

<p>Or, if you prefer eggs with less
fat, use this âfry-poachâ method.
Melt a little fat in a frypan over
low heatâjust enough to grease the
bottom. Add eggs one at a time,
pour in 2 or 3 tablespoons of water,
cover pan tightly, and steam until
eggs are done. Season before
serving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: <em>Use only clean, sound-shelled
eggs in this recipe.</em></p>


<h3>French toast</h3>

<p class="no-indent"><em>6 servings</em></p>

<p class="no-indent">
4 eggs, beaten<br>
â cup milk<br>
Â¼ teaspoon salt<br>
12 slices white bread<br>
2 tablespoons fat or oil<br>
</p>

<p>Combine eggs, milk, and salt.
Dip each side of bread in egg mixture.</p>

<p>Brown on both sides in fat on a
hot griddleâ3 to 4 minutes on each
side. Serve immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: <em>Use only clean, sound-shelled
eggs in this recipe.</em></p>


<p class="no-indent bold"><em>Variation</em></p>

<p>Add Â½ teaspoon cinnamon or nutmeg
to egg mixture before dipping
bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>


<h3>Plain or french omelet</h3>

<p class="no-indent"><em>6 servings</em></p>

<p class="no-indent">
6 eggs<br>
Â¾ teaspoon salt<br>
Pepper, as desired<br>
6 tablespoons milk<br>
3 tablespoons butter or margarine<br>
</p>

<p>Beat eggs until yolks and whites
are well mixed.</p>

<p>Add salt, pepper, and milk.</p>

<p>Melt the fat in a large frypan
and pour in the egg mixture.</p>

<p>Cook over moderate heat. As the
omelet cooks, lift edges toward center
and tip pan so that the uncooked
mixture flows under the cooked portion.
Continue cooking until bottom
is light brown.</p>

<p>Fold one half of the omelet over
the other half and serve at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: <em>Use only clean, sound-shelled
eggs in this recipe.</em></p>


<p class="no-indent bold"><em>Variations</em></p>

<p>Spread tart jelly or browned
mushrooms on half the omelet just
before folding.</p>

<p>Sprinkle top of the omelet with
shredded cheese, your favorite
herbs, or bits of crisp bacon or ham.</p>


<h3>Poached eggs</h3>

<p>Break eggs into a saucer or custard
cup, one at a time, then slip
them into gently boiling, salted
waterâenough water to cover the
eggs in a shallow pan.</p>

<p>Reheat water to simmering, take
pan from heat, cover. Let stand 5
minutes, or until eggs are of desired
firmness. Remove eggs from water
and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: <em>Use only clean, sound-shelled
eggs in this recipe.</em></p>


<h3>Poached eggs supreme</h3>

<p class="no-indent"><em>6 servings</em></p>

<p class="no-indent">
1 can (10Â½ ounces) condensed Cheddar cheese soup<br>
2 tablespoons chopped green pepper<br>
Â¼ cup process sharp Cheddar cheese spread<br>
6 slices toast<br>
6 eggs<br>
</p>

<p>Combine soup and green pepper;

eggs until firm (p. <a href="#Page_38">38</a>). Place eggs
on toast and cover with hot soup
mixture. Serve immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: <em>Use only clean, sound-shelled

<h3>Deviled eggs</h3>

<p class="no-indent">
6 eggs<br>
Â¼ cup mayonnaise<br>
1 teaspoon prepared mustard<br>
Â½ teaspoon vinegar<br>
Â¼ teaspoon salt<br>
White pepper, as desired<br>
Paprika<br>
</p>

<p>Hard-cook eggs as directed on
page <a href="#Page_37">37</a>. Cool eggs under cold
running water 5 to 10 minutes.
Peel shells from eggs. Cut eggs in
half lengthwise. Mash yolks with
remaining ingredients except paprika
until mixture is smooth. Fill
whites with this mixture; sprinkle
with paprika.</p>


<p class="no-indent bold"><em>Variation</em></p>

<p><em>Ham-deviled eggs.</em>âOmit salt.
Add 1 can (2Â¼ ounces) deviled ham

<h3>Baked eggs in hash nests</h3>

<p class="no-indent"><em>6 servings</em></p>

<p class="no-indent">
1 can (1 pound, 8 ounces) corned beef hash<br>
6 eggs<br>
2 tablespoons fine dry breadcrumbs, if desired<br>
Salt and pepper, as desired<br>
1 tablespoon butter or margarine<br>
</p>

<p>Spread hash evenly in a 10Â½- by
7- by 2-inch baking pan. Form six
depressions by pressing the bottom

<p>Break an egg into each depression.
Sprinkle each egg with breadcrumbs,
if desired. Sprinkle with
salt and pepper; dot with fat.</p>

<p>Bake at 325Â° F. (slow oven) 20 to
25 minutes, or until eggs are as
firm as desired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: <em>Use only clean, sound-shelled
eggs in this recipe.</em></p>


<p class="no-indent bold"><em>Menu suggestion</em></p>

<p>Serve with mixed vegetables,
lettuce wedges, and brownies.</p>


<h3>Cooking cheese</h3>

<p>Cheese, like eggs, should be
cooked at low temperatures and
never overcooked.</p>

<p>Melt cheese over simmering
water, or add it to a hot mixture.
Add cheese to a sauce after the
sauce is cooked and heat only long
enough to melt the cheese. Add
cheese to an omelet just before
folding.</p>

<p>Bake casseroles containing cheese
at low to moderate temperatures.
To keep cheese toppings from
toughening or hardening, cover the
cheese with crumbs or add cheese
just a few minutes before the
casserole comes out of the oven.</p>

<p>Cheese blends more readily with
other ingredients and melts more
quickly if you shred or dice it
first.</p>


<h3>Spanish rice with cheese</h3>

<h3><em>Cooking dry beans</em></h3>

<p>Dry beans need soaking before
cooking. Use 2Â½ cups water for 1
cup of blackeye beans (blackeye
peas, cowpeas), Great Northern
beans, and lima beans. Use 3 cups
water for 1 cup of kidney beans,
pea (navy) beans, and pinto beans.</p>

<p>To soak them quickly, boil beans
2 minutes, remove from heat, and
let stand 1 hour. Or if you prefer,
boil beans 2 minutes and let them
stand overnight.</p>

<p>Cook the beans in the soaking
water. Add 1 teaspoon salt for 1
cup of beans; boil gently for the
time given below. One cup of uncooked
beans yields about 2Â½ cups
cooked beans.</p>

<p>Dry beans will cook more quickly if
you add baking soda to the water
before soaking. If tap water is of
medium hardness, adding â teaspoon
soda to the water for each cup
of dry beans reduces cooking time
about one-fourth. Measure soda
exactly; too much soda affects flavor
and nutritive value of beans.</p>

<p>To reduce foaming when cooking
dry beans, add 1 tablespoon meat
drippings or other fat to the cooking
water for each cup of beans.</p>

<p>Cooked dry beans may be seasoned
and eaten without further
cooking, or they may be baked,
or combined with other foods.</p>

<p>If acid ingredients like tomatoes,
catsup, or vinegar are included in
the recipe, add them after the beans
are tender. Acids prevent softening
of the beans.</p>

<p>Knowing how to prepare vegetables
to retain their nutritive value
and appetite appeal is a test of
any good cook. To help you improve
your skill with vegetables,
here are some cooking tipsâ</p>

<p>â¢ Boil vegetables in as little
water as possible; losses in vitamins
and minerals will be less, the less
water you use. Serve the cooking
liquids with your vegetables, or
make them into sauces, gravies, or
soups.</p>

<p>â¢ Cook vegetables until just tender,
and serve them immediately;
they will taste better and retain
more nutrients.</p>

<p>â¢ Trim leafy vegetables like
lettuce and cabbage sparingly. Use
the dark outer leavesâthey are
especially rich in nutrients. Remove
woody midribs from kale
leavesâthere is little nutritive loss
and the kale cooks more uniformly.</p>


<h3 id="fresh4">Fresh vegetables</h3>


<p class="no-indent bold"><em>Preparing for cooking</em></p>

<p>Wash vegetables thoroughly. Use
plenty of water for leafy greens;
wash several times, lifting vegetables
from the water.</p>

<p>Remove bruised, wilted, or tough
parts; trim sparingly.</p>

<p>Soak fresh brussels sprouts and
broccoli in cold salt water (2 teaspoons
salt for each quart of water)
30 to 60 minutes to remove any
insects.</p>


<p class="no-indent bold"><em>Cooking times</em></p>

<p>In using the Boiling Guide for
Fresh Vegetables on the following page,
remember that vegetables
may require shorter or longer cooking
time than given, the exact time
depending on quality and variety
of vegetable. The altitude at which
you live will also affect cooking
times; you can shorten the time by
cutting, slicing, dicing, or coarsely
shredding vegetables.</p>


<h3><em>Boiling fresh vegetables</em></h3>

<p>Bring salted water to a boil.
One-half to 1 cup water usually is
enough for 6 servings of young,
tender vegetables. Older root vegetables
that need longer cooking may
require water to cover. Spinach and
other greens need only the water
clinging to their leaves from washing
if cooked over low heat in a pan
with a tight-fitting lid. Tomatoes
can be cooked in their own juice.</p>

<p>Add vegetable. Cover, and quickly
bring water back to a boil.
Reduce heat and cook gently until
vegetable is just tender. Start
timing after water returns to
boiling.</p>


<h3 id="frozen4">Frozen and canned vegetables</h3>

<p><em>Frozen.</em>âCook frozen vegetables
according to package directions.
For uniform cooking, thaw leafy
vegetables just enough to separate
the leaves before you put them in
boiling water. Partly thaw corn on
the cob before cooking it. If necessary,
separate pieces of frozen vegetables
with a fork during cooking.</p>

<p><em>Canned.</em>âCommercially canned
vegetables need reheating only. If
liquid is not served with the vegetable,
save it for other uses. (See
Ways to Use Leftovers, p. <a href="#Page_75">75</a>.)</p>

<p>Unless you are absolutely sure
home-canned vegetables have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
processed correctly, bring them to
a rolling boil. Then cover and boil
for at least 10 minutes. Boil spinach
and corn 20 minutes. If food looks
spoiled, foams, or has an off-odor
during heating, destroy it.</p>


<h3 id="serving">Serving boiled vegetables</h3>

<p><em>Hot, seasoned.</em>âAny vegetable or
a combination of two or more.</p>

<p>Before cooking, add a pinch of
an herb, such as marjoram or thyme.
Or after cooking, season with butter,
margarine, or drippingsâor with
salad oil and lemon juice, horseradish,
or garlic. Or sprinkle cooked
vegetables with herb vinegar or
crumbled bacon.</p>

<p><em>Mashed.</em>âPotatoes, sweetpotatoes,
turnips, rutabagas, kohlrabi,
carrots, winter squash.</p>

<p>Drain and mash cooked vegetable.
Add hot milk or cream to moisten if
needed. Season with salt, pepper,
and butter or margarine. Beat until
fluffy.</p>

<p><em>Creamed.</em>âPeas, carrots, celery,
cabbage, asparagus, broccoli, potatoes,
snap beans, onions, lima beans,
cauliflower, spinach.</p>

<p>For 6 servings, combine 3 cups
drained cooked vegetable with 1Â½
cups medium white sauce (p. <a href="#Page_57">57</a>);
heat. You may prefer thin white
sauce with potatoes or lima beans.</p>

<p>For quick creamed vegetables,
pour 1 can (10Â½ ounces) undiluted
condensed soupâCheddar cheese or
cream of celery or mushroomâover
3 cups drained cooked vegetable;
heat.</p>

<h3>Panned vegetables</h3>

<p>Panning is a good way to cook
cabbage, carrots, or corn.</p>

<p>For 6 servings, use 1Â½ quarts
finely shredded cabbage or 1 quart
cut corn or thinly sliced carrots.</p>

<p>Heat 1Â½ to 2 tablespoons butter,

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Salads_and_Salad">Salads and Salad
Dressings</h2>
</div>


<p>What better way to serve a
variety of fruits, vegetables, even
meatsâthan in a colorful salad? As
an appetizer, a side dish, a dessert,
or the main course of your meal, a
salad brings lots of goodness to your
table. Salads can be light or hearty,
depending on the ingredients you
choose.</p>

<p>Summertime salads often feature
a medley of fresh fruits. Tossed
green salads are year-round
favorites. Salads made from eggs
and potatoes, from seafoods, and
from meats and cheeses also deserve
a place in your meal planning.</p>


<h3 id="tips2">Tips on salad making</h3>

<p>Selecting top-quality fruits and
vegetables is a good start toward
a good salad. Fresh food has eye
and taste appeal.</p>

<p>Give salad foods the best care
to avoid damage and to keep them
fresh. If you prepare salad ingredients
ahead of time, store them,
without dressing, in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>If you plan to use unpeeled fruits
or vegetables in a salad, choose
those with smooth, tender, colorful
skins.</p>

<p>See page <a href="#Page_12">12</a> for other pointers
on selecting fresh fruits and vegetables.
Youâll find suggestions for
storing them on page <a href="#Page_14">14</a>.</p>


<h3><em>For appetite appeal</em></h3>

<p>Chill ingredients before you mix
your salad.</p>

<p>For tossed green salads, tear
greens into fairly large pieces. This
will give your salad more body.</p>

<p>Always thoroughly drain the
greens you use in salads.</p>

<p>Vary your salad greens. Try
chicory, escarole, endive, kale, spinach,
dandelion greens, romaine,
watercress, and chinese cabbage.</p>

<p>Some salad fruits are likely to
turn dark on standing; dip these
in a little citrus juice.</p>

<p>Drain canned fruits and vegetables
before you add them to a
salad.</p>


<h3 id="tips3">Tips on dressings</h3>

<p>Main-dish salads made with meat,
fish, poultry, eggs, beans, cheese, or
potatoes usually call for a mayonnaise-type
dressing, but some are
good with french or italian dressing
(p. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>).</p>

<p>On vegetable salads and vegetable-fruit
combinations, try french,
italian, thousand island, or Roquefort
or blue cheese dressing (p. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>).
Fruit salads taste best with sweet
dressingsâsweet french, orange-honey,
or celery seed dressing
([p. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>]).</p>

<p>Prevent sogginess and wilting by
using just enough salad dressing to
moisten ingredients. Add dressing
to raw vegetable salads at the last
minute unless your recipe calls for
marinated vegetables.</p>


<h3 id="salad">Salad go-togethers</h3>

<p>Some salad combinations are
traditionalâlettuce and sliced tomatoes,
canned peaches and cottage
cheese. You can make a variety of
salads by sometimes contrasting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>

complementing them.</p>

family fare. You can make them
fancy for teas and partiesâlight
for snacksâor hearty for the main
course at lunch or supper.</p>

<p>Spread sandwich fillings generously,
all the way to the edge of
the bread. Fillings should be moist,
but not wet. Experiment with new
fillings, and with different kinds of
bread.</p>

<p>Dessert adds a touch that gives a
good dinner its final, satisfying
note.</p>

<p>Before using the dessert recipes
in this bulletin, refer to the section
on ingredients and measurements
(p. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>).</p>

<p>Cake recipes in this publication
generally need to be adapted for
use in high-altitude areas. Write to
your State Experiment Station or
contact your county extension agent
for information on baking cakes in
your area.</p>

<p>For pies and cakes, use pans of
the size specified.</p>

<p>To grease pans for cakes, coat
lightly with unsalted fat or oil.
Then sprinkle lightly with a little
flour. Tip pan from side to side to
coat evenly; then shake out excess
flour.</p>

<p>In recipes that call for greased
and floured cakepans, you may use
a wax paper lining if you prefer.
Cut wax paper to fit the bottom of
the pan. Then grease the paper
lightly.</p>

when pressed.</p>

<p>Shape dough into a ball. Roll out
on a lightly floured surface or between
two sheets of waxed paper.
Fit carefully into piepan. Lift edges
and smooth out air bubbles. For

<h2 class="center no-indent">Ways to Use
Leftovers</h2>

<p>Donât throw good leftover food
away. Use your cooking skillâand
your imaginationâto make leftovers
tasty.</p>

<p>Some leftovers make good second
meals merely by reheating. Others
are better prepared in a new wayâwith
seasonings, sauces, crisp toppings.
Try leftover fruit in muffins,
vegetables in omelets. Substitute
2 leftover egg yolks for 1 whole egg
in baked custard. And soups often
become richer, more delicious when
leftovers are added.</p>

<p>Listed below are some of the
ways in which leftovers may be
used.</p>

<p>FAMILY FARE is a result of USDA research. Here, the Agricultural Research
Service brings together information on nutrition, food management, and food
preparation.</p>

<p>Guidelines for nutritious meal planning and for food management came from
the Consumer and Food Economics Research Division of ARS. Basic cooking
methods and recipes were developed and taste-tested in the ARS Food Quality
and Use Laboratory of the Human Nutrition Research Division. Fish recipes
and information on buying fish were contributed by home economists in the
Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, Department of the Interior.</p>
